# Dynamic Linear Modeling (DLM) for Energy Data

## Overview
This repository contains code for performing Dynamic Linear Modeling (DLM) on energy consumption data, incorporating exogenous variables such as meteorological data, calendar data, and occupancy data. The primary objectives of this code are:

1. Decompose the energy consumption data into trend components.
2. Identify and analyze yearly and weekly seasonal patterns.
3. Assess the impact of exogenous factors on energy consumption.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you'll need to provide the following data:

- Energy consumption data
- Meteorological data
- Calendar data
- Occupancy data

## Usage
Here's a brief guide on how to use this code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare your energy consumption, meteorological, calendar, and occupancy data.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to run the DLM analysis.
4. Explore the results and insights generated by the code.
